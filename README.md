# Practical Deep Learning Course

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Practical Deep Learning Course. Here you will find all the code, notebooks, and resources used throughout the course.


## Repository Content

The content in this repository is divided into five key modules, focusing on various aspects of **Deep Learning**. Each module includes Jupyter notebooks combining theory, code, and explanations.

- **Module 1: Deep Learning Fundamentals**: 'class/Fundamentals'
  - [NN_Fundamentals](./class/Fundamentals/NN_Fundamentals.ipynb): This notebook introduces the basics of Deep Learning using TensorFlow. You will learn about TensorFlow's Sequential and Functional API, which are key tools for building neural networks.
  - [Prevent_Overfitting](./class/Fundamentals/Prevent_Overfitting.ipynb): Here we explore various Regularization Techniques that can prevent overfitting in neural networks.

- **Module 2: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: 'class/CNN'
  - [Introduction_to_CNN.ipynb](./class/CNN/Introduction_to_CNN.ipynb): This notebook provides an introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their applications in Image Processing.

- **Module 3: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: 'class/RNN'
  - [Introduction_to_RNN_Time_Series.ipynb](./class/RNN/Introduction_to_RNN_Time_Series.ipynb): Here we introduce Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and show how they can be used for Time Series Analysis.

- **Module 4: Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Deep Learning**: 'class/NLP'

- **Module 5: Generative Models**: 'class/generative'

In addition to these practical modules, we provide a brief theoretical overview in the [Deep Learning with TensorFlow notebook](./Deep_learning_with_Tensorflow.ipynb). This resource offers a concise recap of essential deep learning concepts, acting as a handy reference guide.

## How to Run the Code

The Jupyter notebooks provided in this course can be run either locally on your machine or remotely on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

### Running Locally

To install TensorFlow and TensorFlow-hub, run:
```shell
pip install tensorflow
pip install --upgrade tensorflow-hub
```
For more details see [TensorFlow installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)

To install all the dependencies, run:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running on Google Colab

You can upload the notebook directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or you can click in the Colab icon at the beginning of each notebook:
